`idElement: "NeoxDashHeader"` is the **ID of the component element**, and it is crucial for communication
with your Live Component. This ID is typically the **same name as the component itself**, allowing you
to interact with it seamlessly.

### Example:
For a component located at `Twig/Components/NeoxDashHeader.php`, you would set the `idElement` as
`"NeoxDashHeader"` to reference this specific component in your JavaScript code. This ID allows you
to "speak" directly with the component when triggering actions or updates from JavaScript.
